                  My name is _________________. I am studying Computer
                  Science and Engineering Bangladesh University of Engineering
                  and Technology (BUET). I was born in Dhaka, the capital of
                  Bangladesh, in 1998. I expect to graduate within 2021. I am an aspiring software developer.
                  I also love data science and problem solving. I have interest in computer security and I am 
                  currently doing my thesis on Bio-informatics. As a student I am still exploring different branch
                  of computer science.I am not absolutely sure which will be my ultimate path after graduation.
                  But its fun to be in an era of knowledge where you can take a sip from every branch of knowledge
                  whenever you can.

                  If you are still reading this, you probably want to know about my personal life. Anything professiona
                  is already taken care of in the first paragraph. I would probably edit this part more often. So here we go.
                  I was born in a year that probably isn't that significant, but it was really close to 2000, start of a new
                  Millenium, a event for which every computer in the world would have to change their date storage system and
                  turn it from 2 digits to 4 digits. To me, birthdays aren't that significant. What is a birthday anyway? A day in
                  a year where the relative position of earth and sun are exactly the same as the day you where born. Why does this
                  relative position even matter? But if you ask me my birthday, it would be 29th september. September 29 is the 
                  272nd day of the year(273rd in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar. 93 days remain until the end of the year.
                  yes, the last line is from wikipedia.And no, I searched, nothing significant happened this day, well atleast
                  not significant enough according to me. My early life was mostly spend in a there bedroom apartment in Malibagh,
                  a middle class area in the heart of the capital. We lived in a small lane, but still the lane was crowded
                  with traffic. Growing up we didn't have a lot of money, but we had enough to be happy. We didn't go to fancy 
                  restaurants or rode a fancy car, but we did occationally cook Polao and Corma in our home and we did visit 
                  our relatives in holidays.

                  My first School was Radient Precadet School. It was less of a school and more of a kintergarden. I loved it.
                  I met my first friends in that school. 2 of them I am still connected with in facebook. after 2 years of Playgroups
                  and kintergarden, I moved to class 1 in Motijheel Govt. Boys Hight School. Here I spend 10 years and graduated 
                  in year 2013 with SSC examination. After that I got admitted to Dhaka City College. After HSC examination,
                  I cracked the Engineering admission test and got admitted to Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)
                  It is a dream place for most of the Bangladeshi students. I am blessed and honored to get a chance to study here.

                  I started Debating when i was in class 6. With in four years, I won more than 15 inter school debate
                  tournaments. My team also became the second runner up in national debate competition arranged by 
                  BTV (Bangladesh Television). I also went to the final in 3 inter University Debate competition after I 
                  got admitted in BUET. I also won 3 hackathons, went to the final rounds of 2 business case study competitions
                  and won the HULT Prize BUET. The international rounds of the HULT prize was held in 21 different regions
                  and we competed in Mumbai. I also have prizes in acting, poetry, extempore speach and essay writting.

                  My inspiration has always been to have fun with studies. I am one of those fortunate people who enjoy
                  studing and knowing new things. And so it was quite easy for me to always focus on my education and
                  projects. I never try to set hard and fast time schedule for myself. Instead I kind of do things in my
                  own pace. I plan ahead and take less time in execution. 
                  So, now you know little something about me. If you want to connect to me, please send me a friend request
                  in facebook. Or you can follow me in linkedin.
